# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This project uses an LSTM neural network to predict stock prices based on historical closing price data.

## Features

✅ Data preprocessing with MinMaxScaler  
✅ LSTM-based sequence modeling  
✅ Visualization of predictions  

## How to Use

1. Place your stock CSV file (e.g., AAPL.csv) in the project folder  
2. Update the script if needed to match your CSV format  
3. Run `stock_lstm.py` to train and visualize predictions

## Requirements

- Python 3  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
